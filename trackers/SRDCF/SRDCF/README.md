This MATLAB code implements the SRDCF tracker [1].

Installation:
If the pre-compiled mexfiles do not work, the provided compilemex_[linux|windows] should compile them from the provided source code. Alternatively, you can try to modify them for your system.

Instructions;
* The "demo.m" script runs the tracker on the provided "Couple" sequence.
* The "run_SRDCF.m" function can be directly integrated to the Online Tracking Benchmark (OTB).
* The "run_SRDCF.m" contains the default parameters used to produce the results reported in the paper [1].
